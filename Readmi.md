# ðŸ§  Contextual Word Sense Disambiguator (CLI Tool)

This Python-based command-line tool performs **Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD)** using **NLTK's Lesk algorithm**. Given a sentence, it identifies ambiguous (polysemous) words like *bank*, *bat*, *crane*, etc., and returns the most contextually appropriate **WordNet sense**, including its **definition** and **examples**.
